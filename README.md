This is my first project in Game Development!

It is an Arcade game, where your purpose is to make highscore by clicking each of these crates coming up from the ground. Be careful! There are bad targets as well, that will reduce your score and prevent you from getting  highscore. There are also difficulties that you can choose, in order to challenge yourself. Could you make it very far? It's up to you!
